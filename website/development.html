                    <p>
                    We wanted to create a place where students who are graduating or just moving out of an apartment can give or sell their furniture to students who are moving into a new apartment or dorm. Since the purchasing student may not have transportation or may not even be in state when an item goes up for sale, we wanted to integrate a service that allows buyers to request a driver to transport or even store the item for them.
                    </p>
            </div>

            <div class ="row">
                <h3 class ="section-sub-heading">Result</h2>
                    <p>
                        As of right now, our site is functional and allows a user to sign up, log in, search through everything people have posted and filter the results. Clicking on a listing will allow a user to see more information and put them in contact with the seller. Users can 'like' an image to keep track of it. They can also post their own items for sale, include an image, and tag it with a filter (bathroom, bedroom, etc). When a user is ready to make their purchase, they can go to the list of active drivers to transport and/or store the intended item if they are out-of-state or without transportation. Finally, users can sign up to be smuvers themselves and set themselves as active or inactive. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There are some areas for improvement. A user would need to be vetted before they're allowed to be a driver. It's also not possible to delete posts. There are currently a few other small bugs, but the site 'just works' so to speak. We are confident in the SMUve's appearance and function. With an active team maintaining the site and added security, we believe that SMUve would be very helpful for SMU students.

                        Our biggest functional issue as a team was doing things at the last minute. Nonetheless, everyone did their job. While our site is not ready to be used by the public, it's a great working prototype.
